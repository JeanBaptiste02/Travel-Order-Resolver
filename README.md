# Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Travel Commands


Demonstrates the process of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the context of travel-related commands. The goal is to identify and classify entities such as departure and arrival locations in textual data.

The notebook includes the following key steps:

1. **Loading Data**: Read the dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Preprocessing Data**: Clean and prepare the data for model training.
3. **NER with spaCy**: Use a pre-trained spaCy model to identify entities.
4. **NER with Transformers**: Utilize a pre-trained Transformers model for entity recognition.
5. **Training a Custom NER Model**: Fine-tune a spaCy model on custom NER data.
6. **Building and Training an RNN Model**: Prepare data and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for NER.
