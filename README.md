# Travel Order Resolver

**Travel Order Resolver** is a project that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze travel commands and provide an optimal itinerary based on train schedules. This project is part of the **Master of Science (M2)** program at **EPITECH**.

## Features

- **Text Analysis (NLP)**: Identifies travel commands and extracts departure and destination cities.
- **Itinerary Optimization**: Calculates the best route between cities based on available train schedules.
- **Voice Recognition (optional)**: Converts voice commands into text for processing.

## Main Modules

1. **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Interprets travel requests in French and extracts key information.
2. **Pathfinding (Itinerary Optimization)**: Finds the best route between the departure and destination cities using train schedules.
3. **Voice Recognition (optional)**: Converts spoken commands into text for NLP analysis.

## Objective

This project aims to automate the travel planning process by analyzing text or voice commands and providing an optimized itinerary. The application is designed to handle French queries, taking into account the variety of phrasing and potential spelling errors.
